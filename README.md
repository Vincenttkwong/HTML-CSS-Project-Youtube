# YouTube Landing Page Clone â€“ HTML/CSS Project

## Overview

This project is a static recreation of the YouTube landing page built using **HTML5** and **CSS**. It was one of my first web development projects and served as an opportunity to learn how to structure a webpage, style it with CSS, and use hyperlinks to simulate navigation. The layout mimics the real YouTube homepage, featuring thumbnails, video titles, channel icons, and a styled navigation sidebar and header.
